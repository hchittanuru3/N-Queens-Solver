# CS 4649 Homework 2

## Running the Code
The code is written in Python 3. To run this code, you can enter one of the following commands:

* ```python3 runner.py plot```: This is to generate the plot for each algorithm.
* ```python3 runner.py [search] [n]```: This is to run the search method for a value of *n*. The following are the search methods for each number argument.
    1. To run standard search, the search argument would be 1.
    2. To run backtrack search, the search argument would be 2.
    3. To run backtrack with forward checking, the search argument would be 3.
    4. To run backtrack with forward checking and dynamic variable ordering, the search argument would be 4.
